Repo for our COEN 174 project

Notes: 
- make sure you have all the required libraries installed --> see requirements.txt (add to the file whenever you install and use another library)
- all html files go in the templates folder 
- all styling files go in static folder
- forms.py is where we define the forms that we are making (i.e. login, register, create a new thread..etc)
- models.py is where we define the structure of our database tables (i.e. users, posts..etc)
- app.py is where we define all the url paths. we can use the function name when referring to paths in our html files
